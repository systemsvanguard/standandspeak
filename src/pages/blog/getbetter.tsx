      <h1 className="text-primary">How To Get Better At Public Speaking: A Few Tips!</h1>

      <p>Let’s start with the basics. "Communication" is the act of sharing thoughts, ideas, or emotions with others.   It’s something we all do daily—whether we're chatting with a friend, writing an email, or giving a team update. "Public speaking", however, takes this one step further. It’s the structured, intentional act of addressing a group (2 or more) of people to inform, persuade, inspire, or entertain. And believe me, it’s a skill anyone can learn—with patience and practice.</p>

      <p>Why is public speaking so important? Well, in both personal and professional life, the ability to speak clearly and confidently is a tremendous asset. For professionals aiming to climb the career ladder, good public speaking can set you apart in meetings, presentations, or leadership roles.  Public Speaking to inform and to persuade is an especially valuable skill at work. And for new college graduates? Being articulate during job interviews or when networking can make a powerful first impression.</p>

      <p>Now, let’s dive into a few practical tips that can help you improve your public speaking abilities—whether you’re working solo or alongside a group of like-minded learners.</p>
      

      <h2>Some Tips! </h2> 

      <h3 className="text-primary">1. Practice, practice, practice.</h3>
      <p>There’s no substitute for repetition. The more you speak, the more comfortable you become. Practice your speech aloud multiple times—even if it’s just to your living room furniture.</p>

      <h3 className="text-primary">2. Record yourself on Zoom or your phone.</h3>
      <p>This is a game-changer. Set up a private Zoom call or use your phone to record yourself delivering your talk. Then watch the playback—not to judge, but to observe your tone, body language, pacing, and any distracting habits.</p>

      <h3 className="text-primary">3. Mind your filler words.</h3>
      <p>“Um,” “ah,” “like”—we all have them. Tools like Yoodli, or even AI-based apps like ChatGPT, can help you track filler words. Or, ask a friend to count them while you practice.</p>

      <h3 className="text-primary">4. Join a speech training group like Toastmasters.</h3>
      <p>Toastmasters clubs are fantastic places to learn by doing, and were huge in helping me build my confidence. You’ll receive structured guidance, support, and feedback—all in a friendly, nonjudgmental environment.  In a nutshell, Toastmasters is a safe, supportive space/ environment of fellow lifelong learners, where you will recieve constructively crafted BUT supportive feedback, and with many, many opportunities to speak.  Whether taking on the role of Timer and giving the Timer Report, or the role of Joke Master, or in giving a formal speech, there will be many opportunities to observe communication in action, to learn, and to pracice speaking.</p>

      <h3 className="text-primary">5. Find an Accountability Partner.</h3>
      <p>Having a peer to practice with makes a world of difference. Give each other feedback, set weekly goals, and cheer one another on. A "Partner in Crime" / Fellow Learner helps "keep you feet to the fire", give you feedback, and helps learning significantly, especially if you feel tempted to quit or slack-off.</p>

      <h3 className="text-primary">6. Mirror, Mirror On The Wall!</h3>
      <p>Speak in front of a mirror. Yes, it’s a classic, and it still works! Watching yourself as you speak can help you become more aware of facial expressions, gestures, and nervous tics.</p>

      <h3 className="text-primary">7. Time yourself.</h3>
      <p>Many speeches go off track because the speaker didn’t rehearse with timing in mind. Use your phone or a stopwatch to ensure your message fits your allotted time.</p>


      <img src={`/images/young_speaker_01.webp`} alt="Confident Young Speakers" className="img-fluid mb-3 rounded" style={{ maxWidth: '650px', height: '280px' }} /><br />

      <h3 className="text-primary">8. Use bullet points, not full scripts.</h3>
      <p>It’s tempting to write out every word, but that can make your delivery stiff. Instead, jot down key ideas or phrases. This keeps your speech more natural and conversational.</p>

      <h3 className="text-primary">9. Know your audience.</h3>
      <p>Tailor your message to who you're speaking to. A room full of high schoolers might need a different tone than a boardroom of executives. Understand what they care about and speak to those interests.</p>

      <h3 className="text-primary">10. Embrace silence.</h3>
      <p>Don’t fear the pause. A brief moment of silence after a key point can emphasize your message and give the audience time to absorb it.</p>

      <h3 className="text-primary">11. Warm up your voice.</h3>
      <p>Do a few vocal exercises before speaking. Humming, lip trills, or even reading aloud can help loosen your vocal cords and improve clarity.</p>

      <h3 className="text-primary">12. Accept that nerves are normal.</h3>
      <p>Even seasoned speakers feel nervous. The goal isn’t to eliminate nerves but to manage them. Channel that energy into enthusiasm and focus.</p>

      <h2>In Parting ... </h2>
      <p>Finally, remember this: everyone’s journey to confident public speaking looks a little different. Some folks improve quickly, while others take longer to find their rhythm—and that’s okay. Keep practicing, be kind to yourself, and celebrate every small victory along the way.</p>

      <p>Now go forth, stand, and speak with confidence.  You've got this! </p>
