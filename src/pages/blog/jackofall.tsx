      <h1>Jack of All Trades ... An Incomplete Quote</h1>
      <h3 className=" text-primary">The original full quote was intended as a compliment!</h3>


      <p>Being an <em><strong>IT Specialist</strong></em> 🤓 for many years, I have long lived in dread of a popular quote &amp; motto/ watchword of mine; <strong>"Jack of ALL trades, and Master of None!"</strong></p>
      <p>Horrors of horrors! 😨 No professional wants that tag-line directed at them. A painful quote for me, as I am a curious soul, a natural "dabbler", and a tech dilettante. I have struggled to reconcile the concepts of specialization, "narrow focus", deliberate mastery, and the "<strong>10,000 Hour Rule</strong>", with these other 2 quotes I love :</p>
      <ol>
      <li>"If you’re the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room." ~ Unknown</li>
      <li>"It is hard to fill a cup that is already full" ~ Mo'at - Avatar (2009)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Re the infamous <em><strong>"master of none"</strong></em> quote, in October 2022 a good friend of mine, Liban G. educated &amp; liberated me that I only had 1/2 the quote! 😲 ... and that the quote was initially a compliment with the opposite meaning of how it's interpreted now. Here is the full quote:</p>

      <blockquote className="blockquote p-3 text-bg-light text-primary">
        <p className="h4">"A <strong><em>Jack of All Trades</em></strong> is a master of none, ... <strong>but</strong> oftentimes better than a master of one."</p>
        <footer className="blockquote-footer"><em>Robert Greene about future playwright &amp; poet, <strong>William Shakespeare</strong></em></footer>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Yes ... <strong>THE</strong> William Shakespeare!</p>
      <p>It's worth remembering that the original definition of <em><strong>"amateur"</strong></em> is someone that does something primarily for the love of the thing.</p>
